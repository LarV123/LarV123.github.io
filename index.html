            <h1>Generator PJB</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Generator PJB is a project from ITS VR Lab. This is my first paid team project. The project was to make an educational app to train engineers using VR for a power plant Java-Bali. The application is a simulator on how you dissasemble a Generator.
                The game can determine your score based on how you choose your equipment, do you do the steps on order, etc.

                I work on the screwing system and the scoring system for the application. The screwing system prevents a certain part of the generator to be grabable when there is any screw attached.
                I made the scoring system for the equipment check and the ordering of steps used. The system uses an event based system, such that after each action the player has done, it will go through the scoring system.

                I was honored to be the one who was given the kinect and develop the kinect input system for the other games.

                You play as a droplet of water trying to save the forest from these campfires by solving some puzzles.
                You have some water and you can use it to move some platforms or interact with other things, and most importanly it can be used to put the fires off. 
                Solve the puzzles and save the forest!</p>

            <p>
                I programmed all part of the game. The game is created using Unity. I use component based programming to split the responsibility of the player system. 
                The player component can be split into Player Movement, Player Water Interactor, Player Input, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The save system is using Binary Serializer from .NET and writing it on the application directory. 
                This is not update proof, as there is a compability issue when you change the structure of the save file.
                I am looking forward to solve this issue.

                I am one of the programmers of Spell work. I work on the gameplay mechanics, and the input system. The input system uses the unity new input system. 
                I use proxy design pattern to direct infromation about key or button click to the player system. The system is much like Player Input component from Unity but can handle 2 player from 1 device.
                This is because we want it to be possible to play when you don't have any controller.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also developed an AI using behaviour tree system I programmed myself. The AI is still a bit buggy and it may need some work on UI. 
                Because the current system's node is coded strictly on the code.

                You can't craft random items because there are customers coming to your store and they will expect you to have what they need. 
                You lose money if you piss off a customer. Buy more resources with the money you earned. Earn as much as you can because there is not much time left.

                I made the whole system. The game consist of the customer system, shop system, inventory system, and the game over logic. 
                I also developed a simple sound system using Unity Mixer Group because the game only have 2 basic sound, which is sound effects and music.

            <p>Little Farmer is a small project game for my final project in a College Course. The game is a simple farm management. You take care of chickens by giving them food and water.
                The goal is to reach 10000 coins. You can earn money by selling the eggs, or crafting items and selling them instead. But don't forget to buy water and food.

                I programmed the whole thing myself. The AI for the chicken uses a finite state machine that tells the chicken what to do. 
                It tells them when they are hungry, whether or they should go to the food, etc.

            <p>
                I also make the art for it myself. I use aseprite to draw the arts. The game is inspired by an old game called farm frenzy.
